# Add Copyright

## How Script Works
Script take three runtime inputs 
* file directory we need to add copyright.
* --copyright-file <copyright.txt> 
* --file-extension <.ext> : File extension to which you want to add copyright content.

     **_Note: Check copyright content against file .ext, if copyright content  is syntactically compatible with file extension._**

 `python copyright.py <dir> --copyright-file <copyright.txt> --file-extension <.ext>`
